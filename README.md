# Assignment 1 
This Assignment is about to use student_list_65.csv which is cvs from excel file to sort about the data of each student in that and it can sort by number of student to make it it want to store the object student by using dynamic array to sort you don't use Scanner in put letter from keyboard but use argument to sort argument n to sort by number argument f to sort by name argument l to sort by lastname
# Requirement
If you want to run this program you want to download student_list65.csv to run and you want to set path fire that link asm.java to Student.java to your pathfile from your computer
# about the code 
First you see the program it have a Student.java that is an object to pull that data to main code it have to create a vector to store Student by using dynamic array  that is vector because it can make to write the code easier that don't have vector to store data and usetoken that to make it token about SID firstName lastName to convert into a token and use while .hasnextline to loop taht when it read the student file to the end and token SID firstname lastname and coding to make this program can read the middle name and print the number of all student in this section before show the end of result it want to  create a 2 method about to show the detail of all student and another method is about to sort the student at vector that use collection to sort and come back to main code and use argument to select to sort n to sort by number f to sort by firstname and l to sort by lastname and close the scanner then end of program
# Tutorial of this program 
If you want to use this program you have to download this program and mystudent_list_65.csv after that you have to set a path to your location where you keep these file and put this file to one folder  Warning you have to set up you augument before run this app because if you don't set set up it can't find your main method to set up you have to write on terminal "javac yourfilepath of your two file asm.java and Student.java" second write"java yourfilepath of your main code" and to run you have to set up select to sort by write this"java yourfile and letter" and of tutorial
